<h1>Hi!</h1>

<p>
    Thanks for visiting my page! I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of California, 
    Irvine in the <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/">Center for Algorithms and Theory of Computation</a>. 
    I am pleased to have <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/">Dr. Michael Goodrich</a> as my advisor.
</p>

<p>
    My current interests are in computational geometry and quantum information theory. Below you'll find some blog 
    posts which serve as journals for myself to document my learning.
