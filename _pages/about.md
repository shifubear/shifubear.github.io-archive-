## Hi!

Thanks for visiting my page! I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of California, 
Irvine in the [Center for Algorithms and Theory of Computation]("https://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/"). 
I am pleased to have [Dr. Michael Goodrich]("https://www.ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/") as my advisor.

My interests are in computational geometry and quantum computing.
